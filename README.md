# PY-CL-ReadingFiles

## Overview

This project demonstrates file reading in Python using a simple class named `Lab`. The `Lab` class includes a method `read_file()` to read the contents of a text file.

## Files

### app.py

The `app.py` file serves as the main entry point for the project. It demonstrates the usage of the `Lab` class by reading a text file and printing its contents.

### lab.py

The `lab.py` file contains the implementation of the `Lab` class. It includes the `read_file()` method, which reads the contents of a text file.

### lab_test.py

The `lab_test.py` file contains unit tests for the `Lab` class's `read_file()` method. It ensures that the method behaves as expected by testing it with various input cases.

### example.txt

The `example.txt` file is a sample text file used in the project for demonstration purposes.

## Getting Started

1. Open the `src/main/app.py` file.
2. Run the `app.py` file to execute the example demonstrating the usage of the `Lab` class.
3. Explore the code in `lab.py` to understand the implementation of the `Lab` class's `read_file()` method.
4. Run the unit tests in `lab_test.py` to verify the correctness of the `Lab` class's `read_file()` method.

## Conclusion

This project provides a practical demonstration of file reading in Python using the `Lab` class. By examining the example in `app.py` and exploring the code in `lab.py`, users can gain a better understanding of how to work with file reading operations in Python.

Happy Coding!
